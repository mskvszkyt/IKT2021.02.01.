            <p>Pilots have to pay for the amount of propane they actually filled their cylinders with. The same method
                will be applied as the Europeans 2015. The method is to pay the amount calculated, based on the number
                of planned flights (50 kg per flight, 5 flights at the training competition, 1,5 €/kg) in advance at the
                check-in, and in the end the actual amount put into the cylinders will be calculated and the difference
                in cost will be paid back </p>
